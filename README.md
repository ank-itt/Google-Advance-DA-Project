National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) for the year of 2016-2018.



We examine the locations that had the greatest number of days with at least one lightning strike.
Next, we will determine whether certain days of the week had more lightning strikes than others.
Finally, we will add data from 2016 and 2017 and, for each month, calculate the percentage of total lightning strikes for that year that occurred in that month.
We will then plot this data on a bar graph.
